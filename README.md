# vindinium-ai

Unit tested bot. The intention is to have a framework to allow trying out different bot tactics easily.

If you fork and add common code, please make a PR back to me.

# Next steps

make route finding take a function to calculate route suitability (so not just quickest distance)
Log/investigate why I sometimes get timeouts - whats happening? Break early from calculations?
Add strategies that self score themselves, then the bot picks the winning strategy - e.g. strategy heal - higher score if health lowe
Determine if a mine can be safely won without fear of death
Run from attacking bots
